                <p>A web-based search engine for people with visual impairment. SerpUI pulls real-time results from the <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/overview">Google Custom Search Engine API</a> (from the Google Cloud Services) and presents them with a new interface better suited for people with visual impairment. To add functionality you can connect a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/choose-your-joy-con-color/">Nintendo JoyCon controller</a> for interactive browsing. The product has also undergone evaluations with young users to quantify its usability. The hope is that the online Search Engine experience is more accessible to everyone! The new format separates the two types of data; search results and their content. The user can discover new results by moving up and down, and learn more about each result by moving left and right. Enjoy SERPing!</p>

                <p>This interface was a lot of fun to make! Trying to put yourself in the shoes of others with such different perpectives is challenging to begin with. But when you're asked to find the best way to help them surf the web, things get creative :)</p>

                <p>Along with coordinating the team of Teaching Assistants (TAs), my time was spent writing assignments, building testing equipment, and administrative work. I enjoyed the creative aspects of designing the UI and the functionality of the testing system. The students in this course are tasked with programming the FRDM K64F microcontroller to operate as a pacemaker using the MATLAB Simulink environment. The controller has custom electronics mounted as a shield that mimic real hardware in pacemakers. The project originated from a requirements document published by Boston Scientific.<br><br>This testing system was a huge success and has been used as the course project for three years and counting!</p>

            <p>Capstone is a time for students to spend the year tackling an engineering problem of their choice. Being pool fanatics we decided that billiards partner should be challenging enough. Our group was split into three teams; mechanical, electrical and software. </p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD4AIjvDnsE">The Robot (YouTube)</a>
            <p>
                <h6>Mechanical Team:</h6> Tasked with actually building the thing! We made a 1:1 replica of the pool table in CAD and designed the system down to the nuts and bolts. We spent days in the shop machining, 3D printing and laser cutting over 50 custom parts. The mechanical team also constructed the pneumatic system used to strike the balls (including pistons, compressors and pneumatic values).

                <p>
                    <h6>Electrical Team:</h6> This team was centered around the controls of the robot. Big challenges for this component was to synchronize the motion of the stepper motor to ensure fluid motion that would not shake the table. The electrical team was also responsible for timing and ensuring the shot process was smooth.

            <div>
                <p>
                    <h6>Software Team:</h6> This part was very tricky! In order to determine the best shot several steps were necessary. First the program would capture a picture of the table with a phone mounted on the ceiling. Then the picture would be processed to determine ball colour and location. After an algorithm would run a point-based brute force algorithm to determine the ideal shot angle and power. The information would be relayed to the controls team that would proces and perform the shot.

                <p>This was a fun small project where I got to design and prototype an automated wheelbarrow for pre-production. I was given a motorized front wheel, controls, and a wheelbarrow. The challenge was to make a robust design that could withstand hits and still be able to operate for a full day of work.</p>
