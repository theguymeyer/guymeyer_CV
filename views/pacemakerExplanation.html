                Being a part of the TA team my time was spent refining and grading assignments, along with scheduling and administrative work. During the summer our team would continue and improve the pacemaker testing system. I enjoyed the creative aspects of designing the UI and developing a functional testing system.<br><br> Big thanks to the McMaster CAS Tech team! <br><br> The students in this course are tasked with programming the FRDM K64F microcontroller to operate as a pacemaker using the MATLAB Simulink environment. The controller has custom electronics mounted as a shield that mimic real hardware in pacemakers. The project originated from a requirements document published by Boston Scientific.<br><br>This testing system was a huge success and has been used as the course project for three years and counting!

            <h3>Quick Explanation</h3>
            <p>
                The computer interface lets students dynamically alter the functionality of a simulated heart. They can turn pacing chambers (Atrium and Ventricle) ON and OFF, change the heart rate, and trigger arrhythmia on-the-fly. <br><br>Behind the scenes, commands are sent to the myRIO real-time signal generator that outputs approximated heart pulses to act as input for the pacemaker developed by the student. Once their device is plugged to the 'Testing Block' they can see both the natural heart paces along with the pulses their device generates (this also assists the teaching staff during assessments). This interactive method of teaching was both fun to develop and fun to assess as a Lab Coordinator!
